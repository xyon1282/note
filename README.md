# note
note is a command line notetaking program, made using python. Whenever I'm doing research for a project or to learn a new concept, I find a ton of new terms, ideas and resources that I dont't want to forget. I made this program to keep track of them.

## Usage:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clone the repo:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/xyon1282/note.git
```

Cd into note directory:

```bash
cd note
```

Then use the program using the -t (title) and -b (body flags)

```bash
python note.py -t "Desired Filename" -b "Whatever you want to note down!"
```

If the file named with -t doesen't already exist, then a new one will be created, your note and the timestamp will be written.
